# configuration file for an AWS labeling job

species : 'mouse'

animal_names : ['black','white'] # if you have multiple animals but they can be distinguished from each other, give each one a name (eg ['black','white'])
# if you're only tracking one animal, set animal_names : []

num_obj : 1 # the *minimum* number of identical instances of each animal in a given frame.
# be careful to make sure you're setting num_obj correctly! If you have different numbers of animals, it's best to set num_obj to 1 and instead set animal_names.
# for example, if you have 2 black mice and 1 white mouse, set num_obj : 1 and animal_names : ['first black','second black','white']
# if you have 2 black mice and 2 white mice, you can set num_obj : 2, animal_names : ['black','white']

keypoints : ['nose','right ear','left ear','top of neck','right rear knee','left rear knee','base of tail']
# the actual keypoint names workers see will be generated from animal_names + species + keypoints. So given:
#    animal_names = ['black','white']
#    species='mouse'
#    keypoints=['nose','tail']
# your workforce will be asked to label "black mouse nose","black mouse tail","white mouse nose","white mouse tail"

check_pairs : [['right ear','left ear'],['right rear knee','left rear knee']]
# list of all keypoints pairs that have right/left assignments, or otherwise could get flipped by workers. MARS will screen these during
# post-processing and correct any flips that occurred. We assume people flip part identities less than half the time, so
# MARS uses median annotator consensus to decide on the correct assignment. Note that this could still fail for small numbers
# of workers/image- we recommend 5 workers/image.

  Label each body part of interest on the two mice.
  <br><br>
  <b>Please view Full Instructions for examples.</b>
  <br><br>
  <b>Nose:</b> upper tip of the nose.<br>
  <b>Ears:</b> middle front edge of each ear.<br>
  <b>Neck:</b> top of the neck, at the base of the skull.<br>
  <b>Legs:</b> "knee" at the <b>front curve</b> of each rear leg (see Full Instructions for examples.)<br>
  <b>Tail:</b> base of the tail, where it emerges from the mouse's body.
