# configuration file for an AWS labeling job

species : 'mouse'

animal_names : ['black','white'] # if you have multiple animals but they can be distinguished from each other, give each one a name (eg ['black','white'])
num_obj : 1 # the *minimum* number of identical instances of each animal in animal_names.
# be careful to make sure you're setting num_obj correctly! If you have different numbers of animals, best to set num_obj to 1 and instead update animal_names.
# for example, if you have 2 black mice and 1 white mouse, eg, set num_obj : 1 and animal_names : ['first black','second black','white']
# if you have 2 black mice and 2 white mice, you can set num_obj : 2, animal_names : ['black','white']

keypoints : ['nose','right ear','left ear','top of neck','right rear knee','left rear knee','base of tail']
# the actual keypoint names will be generated from animal_names + species + keypoints. So given:
#    animal_names = ['black','white']
#    species='mouse'
#    keypoints=['nose','tail']
# your workforce will be asked to label "black mouse nose","black mouse tail","white mouse nose","white mouse tail"

bucket : 'white-100' #the unique name of the s3 bucket containing the images to be annotated.
