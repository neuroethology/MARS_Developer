# name the detectors and pose estimators you will train, and specify which
# animals in animal_names (see next section) will be used in training each one.
# If you are leaving animal_names empty ([]) for this project (eg if your
# experiments have a single type of animal), leave the right hand side empty
# here as well. For example, if you are tracking one or more indistinguishable
# black mice, you might write:
# detection:
#   black_top: []
# pose:
#   top: []
# and in the next section, you'd have
# animal_names : []

detection:
  black_top: ['black']
  white_top: ['white']

pose:
  top: ['black','white']

# set to 0 to suppress some terminal output

# keypoint definitions----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# what are we tracking today?
species : 'mouse'

# if you have multiple animals but they can be distinguished from each other,
# give each one a name (eg ['black','white']). If you're only tracking one
# animal (or multiple animals that can't be distinguished), you can set
# animal_names : [], or you may still want to indicate the color of your mouse
# for future records, eg by writing animal_names : ['black']
#
# These names will be visible to AMT workers, so use discriptors rather than
# strain names.
animal_names : ['black','white']

# set the *minimum* number of identical instances of each animal in a given frame.
# be careful to make sure you're setting this correctly! If you have different
# numbers of animals, it's best to set num_obj to 1 and instead set animal_names-
# for example, if you have 2 black mice and 1 white mouse, set:
#   num_obj : 1
#   animal_names : ['first black','second black','white']
# if you have 2 black mice and 2 white mice, set:
#   num_obj : 2
#   animal_names : ['black','white']
num_obj : 1

# the actual keypoint names workers see will be generated from animal_names +
# species + keypoints. So given:
#    animal_names = ['black','white']
#    species='mouse'
#    keypoints=['nose','tail']
# your workforce will be asked to label ["black mouse nose","black mouse tail",
# "white mouse nose","white mouse tail"]
keypoints : ['nose','right ear','left ear','top of neck','right rear knee','left rear knee','base of tail']

# list of all keypoints pairs that have right/left assignments, or otherwise
# could get flipped by workers. MARS will screen these during post-processing
# and correct any flips that occurred. We assume people flip part identities
# less than half the time, so MARS uses median annotator consensus to decide on
# the correct assignment. Note that this could still fail for small numbers
# of workers/image- we recommend 5 workers/image.

  <b>Please view Full Instructions for examples.</b>
  <br><br>
  <b>Nose:</b> upper tip of the nose.<br>
  <b>Ears:</b> middle front edge of each ear.<br>
  <b>Neck:</b> top of the neck, at the base of the skull.<br>
  <b>Legs:</b> "knee" at the <b>front curve</b> of each rear leg (see Full Instructions for examples.)<br>
  <b>Tail:</b> base of the tail, where it emerges from the mouse's body.
